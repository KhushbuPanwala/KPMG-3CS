Hi Kanan,
Below are some specific aspects which needs to be considered
1. Requirement.
Preference 1 - To enable dual authentication in 2 methods (SSO and email)
	SSO for Tenant users and email for Contractors and Contingent Workforce.
Preference 2 - Enable email authentication for all users (available as part of framework)
 
For email authentication mentioned above :
Verification of email I'd is a must.
 
This verification can happen with below option
1. Enable "send activation email" for all users (Tenant, Contractor and Contingent).
2. In bulk upload, it will not be activated,
	the admin will have to go individually and activate this option through edit.
 
Password setting
Current framework - On creating manual entry from front end, an email of "change password" goes to the user.
 
Required Framework-
1. Allow admin to set password while creating user (tenant, contractor,workforce). 
   If the password is set by Admin, default email will not go to the user. 
   However, there is an option which can be enabled by Admin "reset password in next login" 
   which can be enabled if Admin requires.
2. If an option "user set password" selected, admin will not insert password and the user will get an email to generate password.
3. When "user set password" is enabled, "send activation email" will be disabled by default (as the user is verifying email I'd by resetting his password)
 
Hope the above clarifies.
